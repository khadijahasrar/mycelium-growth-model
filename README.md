# mycelium-growth-model
This model, created using NetLogo Web, demonstrates the growth and spread of mycelium over time. Mycelium, the vegetative part of fungi, plays a crucial role in ecosystems by aiding nutrient cycling and soil health. This simulation allows users to adjust parameters and observe how changes impact mycelium development.
